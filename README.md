**Qodana** is a code quality monitoring tool that identifies and suggests fixes for bugs, security vulnerabilities, duplications, and imperfections. Using this GitHub Action, run Qodana with your GitHub workflow to scan your Java, Kotlin, PHP, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript projects (and [other supported technologies by Qodana](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/qodana/supported-technologies.html)).

## Usage

To start running Qodana in your CI pipeline on GitHub all you need is to add the following lines to your workflow file:
```yaml
- uses: JetBrains/qodana-action@v4.2.0  # you can use @main if you want to use the latest version
  with:
    linter: jetbrains/qodana-js:latest  # Docker image full name with a tag
```

If you don't have any prepared workflow file in your repository, you can create a new one by using the example (store it
at `.github/workflows/code_scanning.yml`):

```yaml
name: Code Scanning
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - 'releases/*'

jobs:
  qodana:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: 'Qodana Scan'
        uses: JetBrains/qodana-action@v4.2.0
        with:
          linter: jetbrains/qodana-jvm
```

With the above workflow, Qodana will run on the main branch, release branches and on the pull requests coming to your repository. You will be able to see the results of the scan in the GitHub UI.

### GitHub Pages

If you want to see [the full Qodana report](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/qodana/html-report.html) right on GitHub, you can host it on your repository [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages), using the following example workflow:
```yaml
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ${{ runner.temp }}/qodana/results/report
          destination_dir: ./
```
Note: It's not possible to host multiple reports on GitHub Pages in one repository.


### GitHub code scanning

You can set up [GitHub code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning) with Qodana for your project by adding the following lines after Qodana action to your workflow file:
```yaml
      - uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v1
        with:
          sarif_file: ${{ runner.temp }}/qodana/results/qodana.sarif.json
```
