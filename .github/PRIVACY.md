2. Why We Collect Data and What We Collect
------------------------------------------

We collect data for various reasons, such as:

a) **To provide you with software, services, or information.** We may collect data, including your
Personal Data, that is required to provide you with software, support, and services, license
validation and checking for updates, providing support, reporting issues and bugs, and other
processing connected with the use of JetBrains Products or information. We may use collected data to
develop and test products and services. You may explicitly provide the Personal Data required for
you to receive the software, support, or services, whether you purchase or use JetBrains Products,
use our support forums, sign up for a JetBrains Account, register for a webinar, participate in a
survey, and/or subscribe to receive marketing and/or technical information and content. This data
may also be collected in the course of your using JetBrains Products. We may use [third-party
service providers](https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/privacy/third-parties.html), acting as data
processors, to assist us in providing JetBrains Products to you or in our operations. For example,
we may use [third-party service
providers](https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/privacy/third-parties.html) to provide data storage
and backup services. The legal basis for this data processing is the performance of a contract
between you and us. With your consent, your Personal Data may also be transferred to [third-party
service providers](https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/privacy/third-parties.html), acting as
separate data controllers, who provide products and services complementary to JetBrains Products
(further data processing performed by these service providers is governed by their privacy
policies). The legal basis for this data processing is consent.

b) **To protect us from piracy and the unlawful use of our software or services**. We may collect
data that is necessary to protect us from piracy or the unlawful or unauthorized use of our software
or services, or that is necessary to ensure the security of our software or services, including both
Personal Data provided by you (see above) and data collected in the course of your use of JetBrains
Products. The legal basis for this data processing is JetBrains’ legitimate interest in protection
from piracy and from the unlawful use of JetBrains software and services. Such personal data may
include your IP address and information about your JetBrains Account. Collecting this data may
include asking for your school records to prove that you are indeed a student if you are applying
for a student license. 

c) **To improve our offerings based on usage.** With your consent, we may collect anonymous data
based on your use of JetBrains Products. We use this data to better understand the usage patterns of
our products and the behaviors of our collective audience. At times, we may share this information
in an aggregated anonymous form with third parties. Since the data is anonymous, no personal data is
processed. Please refer to our [Cookie
Notice](https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/privacy/cookie-notice/) for more information regarding
the collection of non-anonymous data (cookies) when you are using the JetBrains Website.

d) **For JetBrains’ internal evidence and to protect the rights and interests of JetBrains and other
users**. We may collect data that is required as evidence of the provision of software and services
to you, of any communication between you and us, of your contact details, of your use of our
software and services, of your compliance with the terms of the agreement between you and JetBrains,
of any payments or refunds, and of any issues or disputes between you and us. We may use and
disclose this data where we believe, in our sole judgment, that it is legitimate and appropriate to
do so to protect our rights and interests and the rights and interests of other users of JetBrains
Products or services, or where we believe there has been a violation of this Privacy Notice that
could affect the interests of JetBrains or its customers for a period corresponding to the statute
of limitations. The legal basis for this data processing is our legitimate interest in keeping
internal evidence and protecting the rights and interests of us and other users.

e) **To promote and market our products and services.** We may use feedback that you voluntarily
provide about our products or services. As permitted by applicable law, we may use such feedback in
the form of anonymized quotes or in other ways in accordance with the JetBrains Terms of Use. We
also may use data that we collect and aggregate to assist us in determining the appropriate
marketing and advertising for our products and services. In doing so, we may share anonymous
aggregated data with third parties to assist us with these efforts. With your consent or if
permitted by applicable law on the legal basis of legitimate interest, we may also use your contact
details to send you commercial communications about our products and services. This may include
reaching out to you if you used a trial or EAP version of a JetBrains Product, if you started a
purchase process on the JetBrains Website but did not complete it, if you have used JetBrains
Products in the past, or in similar scenarios. We may also use [third-party service
providers](https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/privacy/third-parties.html) to assist us with our
email marketing. In that case, the [third-party service
provider](https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/privacy/third-parties.html) will have access to your
email address, your name, and other information necessary to engage in the marketing. Such
[third-party service providers](https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/privacy/third-parties.html)
will act as data processors and will not use your Personal Data for their own purposes. As more
fully described in the **How We Collect Data** section, we also may use [third-party service
providers](https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/privacy/third-parties.html) to assist us with our
digital advertising, including through cross-contextual advertising on third-party properties. In
that case, the [third-party service
provider](https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/privacy/third-parties.html) will have access to your
online identifiers and information about your use of our products and services. The legal basis for
this data processing is our legitimate interest in promoting and marketing our products and
services, or your explicit consent. During conferences or events, we may use badge scanning
services, also called lead retrieval or scanning, where we can scan your badge and collect certain
Personal Data to enable us to contact you for the above-mentioned purposes.

f) **To fulfill legal duties stipulated by accounting, taxation, and other laws**. We may use and
disclose your Personal Data where required by law, such as in keeping and disclosing our accounts,
in keeping and disclosing our tax records, and in response to a court order, valid subpoena, or
other legal process for the period of time required by such laws. The legal basis for this data
processing is our compliance with our legal obligations.

You may object at any time to the processing of your Personal Data unless you provide us with
consent for such processing. In that case, you may revoke your consent. 

Examples of Personal Data involved in data processing include:

described above. This may happen within JetBrains Products, on the JetBrains Website, or in another
environment set up by JetBrains, always in a clear and conspicuous manner. You can manage your
Personal Data and opt-outs as described in Section 5, Transparency, below.

Our products and services are generally not designed for and are not offered to children under the
age of 13. In some cases, there’s an exception to this approach, and children under 13 might be able
to use our products. When a child confirms that they are under 13 years old, we ask for their
parent’s or legal guardian’s email address to obtain permission to process such Personal Data for
this purpose in accordance with COPPA and GDPR. If we don’t receive permission within three (3) days
or we are denied permission, the Personal Data collected through the form will be automatically
deleted after three (3) days. We don’t send marketing communications to children under 15 years old.
Children between the ages of 13 and 16 are asked to confirm that they discussed the processing of
their data with their parents or legal guardians and have their permission. 

5. Transparency

To respect your privacy, before using your Personal Data, we will inform you about the categories of
Personal Data we collect and the purposes we use them for. We will also inform you about the data
management options that you may have. For this purpose, we use agreements, terms of use, and consent

this information (and similar information collected from other services) to deliver personalized
advertisements to you when you visit digital properties within their networks. This practice is
commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising,” “cross-context behavioral advertising,” or
“personalized advertising.

We may also share your Personal Data with certain third parties (such as with tax authorities or
with other government bodies exercising their statutory powers) if we are obliged to do so under
applicable legislation, to protect our legal rights and those of others, or if such sharing is
necessary to achieve the purposes defined in section Why We Collect Data and What We Collect
(especially with government bodies or with parties harmed as a result of violations of applicable

7. Security
-----------

To secure your Personal Data, our products and services are designed with security, data protection,
and privacy in mind.

We encrypt your data in transit and at rest where it is technically feasible. For the protection of
data during transmission, we use an up-to-date TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol to encrypt
your data. To encrypt data at rest, we use strong, up-to-date encryption algorithms, such as
AES-256. All encryption keys are regularly rotated, and access to them is strictly limited.

We thoroughly review all Personal Data usage processes before implementation to help achieve
compliance with applicable data-protection-related laws and to safeguard user information. This is
done to minimize data usage and to make sure that you, as the data owner, are informed about the
processing. When the reason for data storage expires, and we are no longer required to keep it, we
remove your Personal Data from our servers or anonymize it for further usage. Depending on the
activity within which your data is collected, it may appear in datasets used for research. Before
using the datasets for research or other purposes you are not informed of, we remove or anonymize
your Personal Data in the datasets.

We use [suppliers](https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/privacy/third-parties.html) to host our
products and services and JetBrains Websites and to process your data in accordance with this
Privacy Notice. When choosing a supplier, JetBrains performs a supplier risk assessment process to
evaluate their compliance with legal regulations and security standards and help ensure that your
data is stored in a secure location with appropriate security measures in place.For more details
about security at JetBrains, please visit our [Trust Center.](https://trust-center.jetbrains.com/)

8. Location of Your Information

The default location for any Personal Data of our customers is the EU, unless specified otherwise.
For Software as a Service products, we may provide the option for our customers to choose between
hosting their instance in the EU or in [other
regions](https://www.jetbrains.com/privacy-security/data-centers/). For JetBrains AI, the default
location of Personal Data storage may differ; see [this
link](https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/privacy/third-parties/). At times, JetBrains may process
or transfer some of your Personal Data (such as your name and email address) to our affiliate
companies or subprocessors outside the EU. Any such transfer and processing will be done in
accordance with the applicable laws on data protection and this Privacy Notice and will be based on
a relevant adequacy decision of the European Commission, especially regarding standard data
protection clauses. For more information, please

Privacy Notice only applies to JetBrains Websites, so when you visit other websites, even when you
